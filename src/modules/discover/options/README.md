# FilteringOptionsService Documentation

## Overview

The `FilteringOptionsService` is a part of the `discover` module in your project. It provides a set of methods to generate various filtering options that can be used to enhance the user experience by allowing them to filter and sort entertainment content based on different criteria.

## Purpose
